## Problem Statement

__RSVP Movies__ is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project.

## Project Overview
You are a data analyst and an SQL expert. You have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights. For your convenience, the entire analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables.

After analyzing the IMDB dataset we can draw some points based on the listed insights:

❖ A total of __1078 movies__ were produced in the year 2019 in __‘Drama’__ genre. Therefore, RSVP Movies should focus on ‘Drama’ genre for their next project.

❖ Approximately, the future project could have an __average duration__ of __107 mins__.

❖ From the dataset, we can predict that __Dream Warrior Pictures (Ranked 1st) or National Theatre Live (Ranked 2nd)__ or both could be their next project’s production company.

❖ Due to higher average rating, __James Mangold__ can be hired as the __director__ for their next project.

❖ Based on the median rating, __Mammootty__ (Ranked 1st) or __Mohanlal__ (Ranked 2nd) can be hired as the __Actor__ for their next project.

❖ Based on the total votes received and average rating, __Taapsee Pannu__ can be chosen as the __actress__ for their next project.

❖ Based on the total votes and also for the regional feel, __Vijay Sethupathi__ can be hired as the additional actor for their next project.

❖ As a global partner, __Marvel Studios__ (Ranked 1st), __Twentieth Century Fox__ (Ranked 2nd) or __Warner Bros.__ can be chosen as the number of votes received is comparatively higher than other production houses.
